PSR Standards

IN LOADABLE DATA CHANGE THE ACCOUNT TYPES

Adjust how we're passing information such that it utilizes our objects
bank account model , GetAccounts move to a collection model
save user ID in session on login
transaction model, getTransactions move to a collection model
use getter and setters

Make view transactions table smaller and add the sidebar to that and all the other pages

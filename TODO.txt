Comment on our code
PSR Standards

IN LOADABLE DATA CHANGE THE ACCOUNT TYPES

Adjust how we're passing information such that it utilizes our objects
bank account model , GetAccounts move to a collection model
transaction model, getTransactions move to a collection model
use getter and setters


close account is shit and not working...
Make view transactions table smaller and add the sidebar to that and all the other pages 

Make database load info before a model is initially created?

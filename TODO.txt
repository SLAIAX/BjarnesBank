TO DO:

- Format account display
- Create transaction page (hyperlink account name from account display?)
- Format the user create page

• view a detailed list of transactions for a selected account (date/time,
amount, transaction type)
• perform transactions (deposit/withdraw/transfer) on a given account
• filtering (e.g. of accounts by id or transactions by type)
• sorting of transactions by date, asc/desc order
• etc etc etc

Current issues:
Users can have the same username
Users can have multiple accounts with the same name
Fields can be submitted with no data entered within them
Refresh on creating accounts and performing transactions
DELETE ACCOUNTS
Logo doesn't appear when on delete bank account page... I guess I need to do it through the router

NEED TO DEAL WITH TELLING USERS THEY LEFT FIELDS BLANK. TEMP FIX WAS TO RELOAD PAGE
validate transfers amount not null
Make database loadable with data
Types of Accounts
